# roadmapsh_expense-tracker
This repository is my attempt on roadmap.sh's expense tracker project typically assigned in skilled programming roadmaps. Most people post their attempts on the roadmap.sh website (deeply recommended you check out btw), but I decided to be a little extra and post it on github. You can roast my code however you want, but you have to tell me why it sucks.
