# roadmapsh_expense-tracker
My attempt at the expense tracker project from roadmap.sh. This is not intended for use, but as a mock project for practice on relevant material. Criticise or roast this how much you want, I wanna hear ya'lls thoughts.

No contribution requests will be accepted for this project, as it is a solo project. The source code, of course, is open to the public.
